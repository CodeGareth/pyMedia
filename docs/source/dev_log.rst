----------

Starting the technical test just after 3pm today.

Plan: 
    * Intend to scope out the challenge, 
    * Generate the necessary api keys for Flickr and Youtube
    * Maybe build the simple html structure

Scoping: 
    * User needs a search box, video returned, up to 3 pictures returned
    * End points need to return 1 video, 3 pictures
    * Idea: Text Entry + toggle + if photo, number entry appears?

Notes:
    * For Youtube API Key - don't have to go OAuth because I don't care about personal info - just providing a search function
    * API keys collected and stored in a env file kept outside of the git repository
    * Seems I don't actually need a key for Flickr! The public photo feed seems open for all - with further research it seems an api key just expands the search terms
